## Learning Sass

Sass is required to customize Bootstrap. But Bootstrap source code is also good material to study Sass. You can read Bootstrap code and study Sass with referencing Sass documents.

Sass was originally coded in Ruby and several implementations have been created for other languages (see Wikipedia). Three official implementations exist (Ruby, C++, and Dart).

The following are selected documents for studying Sass. It is imcomplete but propably enough for you.

* Sass reference (for Ruby-Sass)
    * Sass builtin functions
    * No command line reference (see `sass --help`)

    * node-sass (node.js interface, used in this tutorial)
        * node-sass CLI
